                <h3>Stars Aren’t Forever</h3>
                <p>
                    Stars may look eternal, but they’re actually undergoing constant change. A star’s life depends
                    heavily on its mass. Small stars like red dwarfs can live for tens of billions of years, while
                    massive stars may last only a few million. As a star burns hydrogen into helium in its core, it
                    emits light and heat. When the fuel runs out, smaller stars expand into red giants and then shrink
                    into white dwarfs. Massive stars explode in spectacular supernovae, sometimes leaving behind neutron
                    stars or collapsing into black holes.

                <h3>Galaxies Collide</h3>
                <p>
                    Galaxies aren’t static — they move and sometimes even crash into each other. When galaxies collide,
                    they merge over billions of years in a cosmic dance of gravity. Surprisingly, despite billions of
                    stars in each galaxy, individual star collisions are rare due to the vast distances between them.
                    The Milky Way is on a slow collision course with the Andromeda Galaxy, and this epic merger is
                    expected to create a new, larger galaxy in about 4.5 billion years.

                <h3>Black Holes Trap Even Light</h3>
                <p>
                    Black holes are formed when massive stars die and their cores collapse under their own gravity. The
                    result is a region of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.
                    This boundary is called the event horizon. While black holes themselves are invisible, we can detect
                    them by observing how they affect nearby matter. Some black holes even power massive jets of
                    radiation visible across billions of light-years.

                <h3>Quasars: The Brightest Beacons</h3>
                <p>
                    Quasars are incredibly luminous objects powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of
                    galaxies. As matter spirals into the black hole, it heats up and releases huge amounts of energy,
                    outshining entire galaxies. Some quasars are so bright that we can see them across the universe,
                    even though they lie billions of light-years away. They provide a glimpse into the early stages of
                    galaxy formation.

                <h3>Pulsars: Cosmic Lighthouses</h3>
                <p>
                    Pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars that emit beams of electromagnetic radiation from their
                    magnetic poles. As they rotate, these beams sweep across space, and if Earth lies in the beam's
                    path, we see a regular pulse of light — like a lighthouse flashing at regular intervals. Some
                    pulsars rotate hundreds of times per second, making them among the most precise clocks in the
                    universe.

                <h3>Nebulae: Stellar Nurseries</h3>
                <p>
                    Nebulae are enormous clouds of gas and dust — the raw material for star formation. Inside these
                    clouds, gravity pulls matter together until nuclear fusion ignites and a star is born. Some nebulae
                    are the remains of exploded stars, while others are birthplaces of new ones. The Orion Nebula,
                    located just 1,344 light-years away, is one of the best-studied regions of star formation.

                <h3>Light Takes Time</h3>
                <p>
                    Light travels at about 300,000 kilometers per second, but the universe is vast. When we observe
                    distant stars or galaxies, we’re seeing light that left them thousands or even billions of years
                    ago. This means we’re looking into the past every time we look at the night sky. Studying this
                    ancient light helps astronomers understand how the universe evolved over time.

                <h3>Earth Is in Motion</h3>
                <p>
                    Our planet is constantly in motion. It spins on its axis at roughly 1,670 kilometers per hour and
                    orbits the Sun at a staggering 107,000 kilometers per hour. Meanwhile, the solar system itself is
                    orbiting the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Despite all this movement, we don’t feel it — Earth’s
                    atmosphere and gravitational balance create a stable environment for life to thrive.

                <h3>Saturn Could Float</h3>
                <p>
                    Saturn may be the second-largest planet in our solar system, but it’s incredibly light for its size.
                    Composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, it has such low density that it would float in water — if
                    you could somehow find a bathtub large enough! Saturn’s stunning ring system also makes it one of
                    the most visually captivating planets in our solar system.
